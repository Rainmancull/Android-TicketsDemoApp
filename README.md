## Authentication

While not required, your application may want to control login-related processes directly.

* **Login**
* **Member Info**
* **Logout**

Tickets SDK handles Login/Logout on it's own, so there is no need for you to manually call any of these methods.


## Information

While not required, your application may want to be informed of operations and use behavior with Authentication and Tickets SDKs.

This information is provided via delegate protocols, basic examples are provided.


## Custom Modules


While not required, your application may want to use Prebuilt Modules or even create your Custom Modules to display underneath the Tickets on the Tickets Listing page.
